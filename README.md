# Diabetic-Retinopathy
Diabetes has emerged as a prevalent disease in recent years, affecting approximately 382 million people globally, with projections estimating an increase to 592 million by 2025. There are two types of diabetes, type I and type II, which can result in complications in crucial organs such as the eyes. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a significant eye disease associated with diabetes, which can lead to damage of the blood vessels in the retina. Among the 382 million individuals with diabetes, 34.6% have diabetic retinopathy. In the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province of Pakistan, DR causes blindness in 4% of the population, with type I diabetes being the most prevalent cause. In KP, 30% of the population has diabetes, and 1.6% of them have type II diabetes. Approximately 30% of diabetic patients have DR, and nearly 2% of these patients have developed complete blindness. The timely detection of DR is crucial in preventing or minimizing its severe consequences. Diabetes impacts the retina, which consists of sensitive nerve cells. DR can be broadly categorized based on the level with which it affects the retina. NPDR can cause severe deterioration of the health of diabetic patients. Initial symptoms include the appearance of tiny, round, and red-colored spots known as microaneurysms (MAs). Hemorrhages (H) can result from weakened blood vessels or MAs breaking and releasing blood, and they can appear as either dot-like or blot-like red lesions. Hemorrhages and MAs are sometimes grouped together and referred to as HMA. Detecting DR in its early stages can be challenging, as it is often asymptomatic. This study aims to leverage advanced deep learning techniques for accurate classification and early diagnosis of DR, with a particular focus on the Efficient-Net model. Developing a robust and efficient DR detection system can contribute to the early management and prevention of vision loss in diabetic patients.
The proposed method utilizing preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning techniques, with a comparison to deep learning models, provides a promising approach for the detection of diabetic retinopathy. Among the evaluated models, the deep learning technique, specifically 0the Efficient-Net model, demonstrated superior performance with an impressive F-score of 90.90. This highlights the effectiveness of deep learning in accurately classifying diabetic retinopathy, outperforming other classifiers such as SVM (F-score of 57.52), K-NN (F-score of 50.12), Na√Øve Bayes (F-score of 45.10), and Decision Tree (F-score of 42.85). Further research can be conducted to explore other deep learning models or combinations of techniques to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of diabetic retinopathy detection. This scheme can be used for early diagnosis and management of diabetic retinopathy, which can potentially help lower the likelihood of losing eyesight in diabetic patients.
